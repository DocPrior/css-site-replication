    <h2>Capture and Share the World's Moments<h2>

    <p>Instagram is a <strong>fast</strong>, <strong>beautiful</strong> and <strong>fun</strong> way to share your life
    with friends and family.

    Take a picture or video, choose a filter to transform its look
    and feel, then post to Instagram &mdash; it's that easy. You can
    even share to Facebook, Twitter, Tumblr and more. It's a
    new way to see the world.

    Oh yeah, did we mention it's free?</p>
